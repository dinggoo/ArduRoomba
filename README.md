# ArduRoomba
This library built for the Arduino IDE allows an Arduino Uno to interface with the 500 family of iRobot Roombas via 
Designed around the iRobot Â® Roomba 500 Open Interface (OI) Specification.
Instructions for how to use and compatbility info can be found below.

## How to Use
Please refer to the information below before proceeding. Please know that improper wiring may result in damage to your Arduino and/or Roomba unit.
The OI operates at 5V logic levels therefore please ensure your specific board/MCU (if not using an Arduino Uno) is compatible with 5V logic levels.
If not, you WILL have to shift voltage levels or risk damage to your board/MCU.

## Compatibilty
IDE(s):
Arduino IDE (tested with version 2.1.1)

Board(s) / MCU(s):
Arduino Uno (tested with R3)
Other MCUs/boards MAY be compatible, but have not been tested. If you would like to test another board or MCU, please share your results by creating a new Issue for this repository.

iRobot Roomba model(s):
